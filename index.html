            <h3>Builing Your Desire Website</h3>
            <p>The web design process starts with a visual concept, which you could sketch by hand or with software like
                Photoshop. Then, you use HTML and CSS to build the website. HTML and CSS are the codes for writing web pages.
                HTML handles the basic structure and ‘bones’ of your page, while CSS handles the style and appearance.</p>

            <p>
                Web developers work independently as freelancers or with company teams to create websites. Depending on the job, these professionals may focus on front-end development, which involves designing sites and producing content, or back-end development, which involves writing code to make website features work. Web developers may also become webmasters for a site, providing maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting when needed.
